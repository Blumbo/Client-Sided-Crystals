# Client-Sided-Crystals

Client-Sided Crystals is a Fabric mod that allows players to interact with End Crystals in real-time independent from ping. Placing crystals will instantly make them appear to the player, and hitting crystals will instantly make them dissapear for the player. This means that players will no longer have junky crystal cooldown, making Crystal PvP more enjoyable and less ping based.  
  
Note that this mod does not remove any actual delay from crystals, it just lets players interact with crystals faster without having to wait for packets from the server.
